## Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of machine learning projects covering both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.

### Overview

Explore a variety of machine learning models designed to address both supervised and unsupervised learning challenges. Each project folder includes the dataset, Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files, and additional documentation.

### Machine Learning Libraries

This repository utilizes various machine learning libraries, including but not limited to:

- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/)
- [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/)

Feel free to dive into the projects to see how these libraries are applied in different scenarios.
